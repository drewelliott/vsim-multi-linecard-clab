How to configure vSIM SROS devices with multiple linecards (distributed chassis)

Some people have reported difficulty in understanding exactly how to build a custom vSIM hardware configuration in [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev), so I am documenting various chassis configurations and including examples.

Please click on the link in the table below to be taken to the documentation for the specific chassis type.
